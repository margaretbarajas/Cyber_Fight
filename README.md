i want to make something that will allow my students to learn their alphabets and their sounds while also having fun by immersing themselves in a classic games similar to mortal combat, as I and many of my students like transformers i want to make it transformers themed. this would not only be fun to play but allows them to learn alongside. interwining art and knowledge makes it easier for people to digest information especially for children who are visual learners.
in my repository i have my src folder which hosts the code that makes the game as well as the proposal to look back on when i'm confused to which direction i'm taking. for this project my strongest suits where definitely coding dialouge and making the game sucessfully into a  multichoice game, however some future areas of improvements is making it more aesthethicly pleasing as i was more focused on the code instead of seperating my time into making the game look child friendly. i also did not get to incorporate much of the learning aspect, this game is more of the introduction and not the actual meat of the game. but based on my skills i'm extremly proud of what i have based on my skills as it takes me much longer to  get a hang of coding.
